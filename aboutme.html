    <h3 class="box-title">ABOUT ME</h3><br>
    <p class="box-description"><br>I'm a 25 y/o Chemist from Norcross, GA. I grew up in France so French
        is my native tongue. Sitcoms and early 2000's cartoons are my favorite. A
        few sitcoms I enjoy are : Community, The Office and New Girl. My
        favorite animal is the elephant. I am a cat and dog person! Traveling is
        my favorite hobby. Lastly, I really enjoy trying new things, primarily food!<br></p>

    <h3 class="box-title">CAREER</h3><br>
    <p class="box-description"><br>I chose to change career paths because I felt like I chose Chemistry
        because it was the subject I understood the most throughout school.
        I was always interested in coding but I wasn't sure if I could pursue
        it without returning to school and doing a 2-4 year program. Thankfully, I
        did some research and found many resources saying that it's not too
        late. I'm excited to learn all about web developement.<br></p>
